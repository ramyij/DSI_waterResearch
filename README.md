# DSI_waterResearch

In this research project, I use the NY Open Data portal to gather and explore information related to the lead content in drinking water in New York State public schools. 

## Exploration Notebook
This Jupyter notebook explores standard statistical analysis such as correlation between age of school plumbing system and lead content. 

## Custering Notebook
This notebook attempts to see relationships across multiple variables such as socio econmic status of the enrolled students.
